# Python Skills Checklist

This checklist helps categorize Python projects into four levels: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, **Advanced**, and **Professional** based on the skills required.

## Table of Contents
1. [Beginner Skills](#beginner-skills)
2. [Intermediate Skills](#intermediate-skills)
3. [Advanced Skills](#advanced-skills)
4. [Professional Skills](#professional-skills)
5. [How to Use the Checklist](#how-to-use-the-checklist)

## Beginner Skills
Projects in this category focus on basic programming concepts, syntax, and foundational problem-solving abilities.

- [ ] Variables and Data Types (int, float, string, boolean)  
- [ ] Conditional Statements (if-else, elif)  
- [ ] Loops (for, while)  
- [ ] Basic Input and Output (`input()`, `print()`)  
- [ ] Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries (Basic Operations)  
- [ ] String Manipulation (concatenation, slicing, `upper()`, `lower()`)  
- [ ] Functions (Defining and Calling Functions)  
- [ ] Exception Handling (`try-except`)  
- [ ] Importing Libraries (`import math`, `import random`)  
- [ ] Simple File Handling (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`)

**Criteria:**  
Projects requiring **6 or fewer skills** from this list = Beginner

---

## Intermediate Skills
Projects in this category involve more structured programming and external library usage.

- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Methods)  
- [ ] Modules and Packages (`from module import`)  
- [ ] Basic Regular Expressions (`re` module)  
- [ ] Working with APIs (`requests` module)  
- [ ] Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Sets)  
- [ ] List Comprehensions and Generators  
- [ ] Basic Plotting (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
- [ ] Basic Databases (`sqlite3`)  
- [ ] Simple GUI Programming (`tkinter`, `PyQt`)  
- [ ] Basic Web Frameworks (Flask Basics)

**Criteria:**  
Projects requiring **6+ Beginner skills and 5 or fewer Intermediate skills** = Intermediate

---

## Advanced Skills
Projects in this category leverage advanced Python concepts, large-scale libraries, and integrations.

- [ ] Advanced OOP Concepts (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes)  
- [ ] Multi-Threading and Multi-Processing (`threading`, `multiprocessing`)  
- [ ] File Handling with Advanced File Formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)  
- [ ] Advanced Regular Expressions and Parsing  
- [ ] Working with NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Firebase, Deta)  
- [ ] Deployment (Docker, Streamlit Deployment, Heroku)  
- [ ] REST API Creation (Flask/Django REST)  
- [ ] Unit Testing (`unittest`, `pytest`)  
- [ ] Advanced Visualization Tools (`Plotly`, `Bokeh`)  
- [ ] Data Manipulation and Analysis (`pandas`, `numpy`)

**Criteria:**  
Projects requiring **7+ Intermediate skills and 5 or fewer Advanced skills** = Advanced

---

## Professional Skills
Projects in this category require expertise in Python for large-scale, production-ready, or domain-specific applications.

- [ ] Advanced Frameworks (Django, FastAPI)  
- [ ] Microservices Architecture  
- [ ] Big Data Handling (`PySpark`, `Dask`)  
- [ ] Cloud Integration (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- [ ] Advanced AI/ML Libraries (`scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`)  
- [ ] Distributed Systems and Networking  
- [ ] Advanced NLP Techniques (BERT, GPT)  
- [ ] CI/CD Pipeline for Python Apps (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)  
- [ ] Automated Testing and QA (Selenium, Robot Framework)  
- [ ] Domain-Specific Tools (Optical Simulations, AR/VR, etc.)

**Criteria:**  
Projects requiring **7+ Advanced skills or Professional-specific skills** = Professional

---

## How to Use the Checklist
1. Evaluate a project against the skills listed.
2. Tally the number of skills required for the project from each category.
3. Use the following thresholds to classify the project:  
   - **Beginner:** ≤6 Beginner skills  
   - **Intermediate:** >6 Beginner skills + ≤5 Intermediate skills  
   - **Advanced:** >7 Intermediate skills + ≤5 Advanced skills  
   - **Professional:** >7 Advanced or Professional-specific skills
